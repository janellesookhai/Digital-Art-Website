                <P>     This piece is a comment on the number of selfies we have today and how it all seems to have been mass-produced in the past two years or so, as well as a comment on how the street art movement has gone from something illegal to something that is sought after.</P>

                <p>     The first thing I think of when I think of the word 'selfie' is that there are so many of them out there. There are selfies being taken literally everywhere you go, the museum, school, the mall, space, and even the bathroom. The truth is, you cannot escape the selfie. The inspiration for this piece came when I saw the street art movement in the film, Exit Through the Gift Shop. After seeing somebody be able to put up hundreds of the exact same photo in only minutes per photo, I was compelled to make my own mass produced selfie.</p>
                <p>From far away the image looks like the average stencil, but if you get closer you will notice that the stencil has a fine coat of gold on it.</p>
