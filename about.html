        <p> I'm Janelle Sookhai and there is nothing in my mind that could possibly be cooler than designing video games for a living. The ultimate goal is to be the best player in the world, but another main goal would be to make the games I love playing. Art has transformed for a hobby to a way to express and show my ideas to people around me. </p>
            <p> My go-to mediums when making art are ink, watercolors, photography, and lino stamps. Although I love experimenting, I always try to find a way I can incorporate my favorite mediums. Lately, I have been experimenting with stencils and street art inspired pieces. I can easily see stencils and spray paint being added to my list of favorites. </p>
            <p>My all time favorite video game would have to be the entire Crash Bandicoot series. Well, Crash and Tetris. Over the years I've expanded my pool of games but those two have stuck with me for as long as I can remember. There's just something about those games that always seems to amuse me.</p>
            <p>Fun fact: This website was designed and coded by me!</p>
